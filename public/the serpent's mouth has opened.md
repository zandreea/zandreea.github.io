the serpent's mouth has opened  
in waiting for me,  
its breath a sweet liquor I need to taste  
and I draw one step closer  
towards its melody.  
  
the hierophant reversed  
dictates with sorrowful malady  
a song for the watchers of the moon,  
but I shall not accept such fate  
this easily.  
  
there will be only silence  
and a soft defeated hissing,  
a figure transfixed by meaninglesness  
as I step into the headlights -  
don't look away.
