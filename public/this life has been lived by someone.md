this life has been lived by someone  
I fail to recognise in the mirror.  
my uncertainty and fears  
throw me in the lion's cage  
and each fang that grazes my skin  
sends me deeper in that haze  
where I don't exist yet I'm awake.  
I am not who I hoped to be  
and though I have stopped  
believing in myself long ago,  
my shadow still follows me.  
life unfolds before my eyes  
like a silk scarf that unwraps  
from around her long slim neck  
and flies into the wind,  
leaving behind the distant memory  
of a sickly sweet perfume.
