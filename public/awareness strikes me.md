1.  
  
awareness strikes me,  
the harsh sun bites into my eyelids,  
and it takes me a moment to remember that  
I am but flesh sewn together by a sadistic God.  
if She has made me in Her image  
what eldritch being must She be.  
I have four thousand eyes and I see nothing.  
I am stitched together roughly with black thread  
of which the edges bleed  
and the mattress stain has taken my shape.  
my nails carve out poems in the palms of my hands  
and my chest quivers uncontrollably.  
I must walk the earth hiding my abominable organs  
behind the closed doors of my skin.  
  
2.  
  
I tear my tongue out, rip it  
to shreds with my fingernails  
and I drag it across the virgin page.  
a crimson trail swirls  
and twists into tortured words.  
the words that leave me empty  
a husk of skin and hopes  
in your eyes, a phantom.  
what is written shall not be erased;  
what is said cannot be taken back.  
and I spill my veins on this page  
so that you may see me  
as my guts unfold before you.  
I hope you like me now  
all torn and worn out  
I hope my now bare soul  
sparks a flame in your heart.  
I tear the page, rip it to shreds  
the crimson crust breaks apart  
you have seen enough.  
  
3.  
  
you close your eyes, I close mine  
and we are submerged into a darkness  
the depth of which we'd never felt before.  
our closeness feels mass-produced.  
the violent ephemerae from before,  
guts, eyes and flesh sewn together  
fade away as sure as blood coagulates.  
memories from a distant past.  
the tendrils of unconsciousness  
tickle the nape of my neck  
and I grab your humid hand.  
a step forward and we plunge.
