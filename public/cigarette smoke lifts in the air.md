cigarette smoke lifts in the air  
as my dreams fade away  
into the coolness of the night;  
I sabotage everything I work for.  
my lungs turn to black once more.  
from the cigarette butt  
between my trembling fingers  
a snowdrop springs forth,  
a doubt born of ash.  
decay is no longer at my doorstep  
but inside the house,  
I've invited death in  
and I don't know how to go back  
before the first finger  
pointed in my direction,  
a snake seeking its prey  
numbing me with its venom,  
before the first malicious laughter  
shattered my glass innocence  
and sent the shards flying  
straight into my mother's eye;  
I was a toothpick then,  
stuck between their ribs,  
now I am a boulder  
they have to carry on their backs.
