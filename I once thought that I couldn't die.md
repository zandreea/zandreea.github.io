I, once, thought that I couldn't die  
because how could I ever cease to see  
your chest move up and down, mellow  
like a blanket of foam on the waves,  
the foggy windows of our house  
fingerprints in the shape of our wishes,  
how would I ever stop experiencing  
this life, delicate like eggshells,  
raindrops on leaves, a gentle stream  
flowing forever. but who knows  
when the stream might freeze?  
when darkness might fall?  
a candle flame extinguished,  
when will I blink for the last time?  
and how can I imagine such absence?  
I, once, thought that I couldn't die  
before the demon took a hold of me  
and forced my gaze onto my thoughts  
which started to wilt  
like a plague was cast upon my soul.  
I, then, felt that I was already dead  
and the only thing left for me to do  
was to follow through.
