Every night my breath  
gets caught between your embrace  
and the deepest blue of the sky.  
what I've been escaping all day  
appears in my nightmare,  
scornful and spiteful.  
I cannot do anything but watch as  
my body becomes possessed -  
they make me pull my teeth out  
and strands of hair fall to the ground.  
In this realm nothing feels real.  
I am looking for you in every dream  
but sometimes my doubts find me first.  
I will always make the mistake, then beg  
for your forgiveness with blood on my hands.  
Red against the white of a dress  
is shocking in that  
my purity is stained by my past.  
Beneath the layer of blood there is a hidden one:  
the guilt, the inadequacy,  
the lack of pride and hope,  
the addiction to running away.  
I have lived many lives, yet I was always me,  
staring down an empty husk  
whenever I'd look in the mirror.  
A carcass made of glass  
shattered in the spots you never kissed.
