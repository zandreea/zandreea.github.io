you gave me a red thread and you said  
that it will guide me home. You took my hand  
and walked me off the dusty road  
into the forest. mushrooms the size of my fists  
yet still less poisonous than you. I should have known then  
that the thread was used to sew your lies  
and would only lead me to destruction.  
days morph into each other  
memories dissolve into the smoke  
and I extinguish my anxiety in the ashtray  
you are my drug and my lover  
a paradox taking shape from my pain,  
I can't give up your soothing and your hatred,  
they are intertwined like snakes  
whose venom slowly numbs my limbs  
and as you wrap your fingers around my throat,  
you whisper, brushing your lips against mine:  
I'll kill you a thousand times over  
just to hold you in my arms while I do it.
