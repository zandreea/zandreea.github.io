my dreams float high  
in scorching flames  
and I reach out just like  
the moth seeks the lightbulb.  
I start towards the blazing sun  
high and higher past the clouds  
but my skin starts to boil  
and my wings drip hot wax on my back.  
my body cannot contain  
the flock of moth-like thoughts  
so alike a mushroom cloud  
that pushes against my carcass  
in an unrecognised prayer  
escape is their mother  
bones break, skin rips apart  
as they're pulled towards the light  
moths of uncertainty and disbelief  
a cracked mirror, its shards  
stuck in the space between my ribs  
a lost love, forgotten to comfort  
moths of wrath and misery  
fall, like Icarus, to the ground.
